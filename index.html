		<h2><em> About me</em></h2>
			<p> My name is Eric Tyler Denney, my friends and family call me ET. I have a 6 month old daughter, her name is Thea Rose Denney she was born October 9th 2018</p>
			<p>I currently work for the united states postal service.
			I am interested in learning to become a software developer. I found out about the software guild through my wife Taylor Denney
			who works for The Learning House.</p>
			<p>I am intrested in learning software development to have a better career. I feel completeing the software guild bootcamp will not only
			help me in the career side of things but also in life by showing that I can accomplish things I never thought I could.</p>
